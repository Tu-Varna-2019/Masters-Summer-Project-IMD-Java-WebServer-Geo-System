# Approaches of working with variables / global config

Currently there are 2 different versions of mapping the configs to the modules:

1. Using the old way of re-defining the config variables
    - non-DRY (do-it-yourself) method
    - reccomended by HashiCorp
    - **current use**

2. By using a global modules
    - not recommened by HashiCorp
    - follows DRY method
    - **currently commented**
